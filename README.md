# Week-3-Assignment
Week 3 Assignment: Regression Models 
in Python
Objective:
The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding of regression models in both Python 
and R. You will be required to demonstrate proficiency in implementing simple linear regression, 
multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression models on a dataset and evaluating their 
performance.
Dataset:
For this assignment, we will use the "Auto MPG" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG). The dataset contains information on various 
attributes of automobiles, such as miles per gallon (mpg), cylinders, displacement, horsepower, 
weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. The goal is to predict the mpg of a car based on its 
attributes.
Instructions:
For each of the following exercises, complete the task in both Python and R. Ensure that your code is 
well-commented to explain each step and your thought process.
Exercise 1: Importing Libraries and Loading Data
Import the required libraries for data handling, visualization, and regression models in Python and R.
Load the Auto MPG dataset into a data structure (e.g., DataFrame in Python) and display the first few 
records.
Exercise 2: Data Pre-processing
Perform basic data pre-processing on the dataset, including handling missing values, duplicates, and 
any outliers.
Apply feature scaling and encoding as needed.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Exercise 3: Simple Linear Regression
Choose a single feature from the dataset (e.g., horsepower) to predict the mpg using simple linear 
regression.
Train a simple linear regression model on the training set using the chosen feature.
Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., 
R-squared, mean squared error).
Exercise 4: Multiple Linear Regression
Choose multiple features from the dataset to predict the mpg using multiple linear regression.
Train a multiple linear regression model on the training set using the chosen features.
Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., 
R-squared, mean squared error).
Exercise 5: Polynomial Regression
Choose a single feature from the dataset (e.g., horsepower) to predict the mpg using polynomial 
regression.
Create polynomial features of the chosen feature (e.g., using degree 2 or 3).
Train a polynomial regression model on the training set using the created polynomial features.
Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., 
R-squared, mean squared error).
Exercise 6: Model Comparison
Compare the performance of the simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial 
regression models.
Discuss the pros and cons of each model and explain which model performs best on the given 
dataset.
Submission:
Submit your commented Python and R code files for each exercise. Ensure your code is wellorganized and easy to read. Your submission should demonstrate your understanding of regression 
models and your ability to apply them to a real-world dataset in both languages. Additionally,
provide a brief summary of the dataset, its characteristics, and the performance of each regression 
model
