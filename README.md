# Week-3-Assignment : Regression Models

Objective:

The purpose of this assignment is to test understanding of regression models in Python . You will be required to demonstrate proficiency in implementing simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression models on a dataset and evaluating their performance.

Dataset:

For this assignment, we will use the "Auto MPG" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG). The dataset contains information on various 
attributes of automobiles, such as miles per gallon (mpg), cylinders, displacement, horsepower, 
weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. The goal is to predict the mpg of a car based on its attributes
